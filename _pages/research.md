My ultimate goal is to employ artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary research as tools to shape a better world. For that, I have delved into the transportation domain as the use case. [The essence of transportation is to reconcile the spatio-temporal imbalance in the distribution of matter, information and energy, which is all about time and space](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-autonomous-driving-transportation-science-fiction-yongqi-dong/?trackingId=7Vv1ACfy%2Ftudg0Q5UUXfFA%3D%3D). Thus, I had attached the utmost importance to the spatial-temporal correlations in my research.

My current research centres around three main pillars, i.e., <br/>
1) **Deep Learning for sensing and anomaly detecting**,<br/>
2) **Deep Reinforcement Learning for controlling and decision-making**,<br/>
3) **Big Data Analytics for spatial-temporal pattern mining**.<br/>

## Big Data Analytics for Spatial-temporal Pattern Mining in Shared Mobility
* **An Empirical Study on Travel Patterns of Internet Based Ride-Sharing** ([Published in TR_C](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2017.10.022))<br/>
  - On-demand ride-sharing is quite different from taxi<br/>
  - In Beijing, on the macrocosmic level, on-demand ride-sharing mainly serves as an approach for home-work commuting<br/>
  - Internet-based on-demand ride-sharing drivers intend to make longer trips than taxis, and detour further to pick up passengers than hitchhike drivers<br/>
**Regarding Individual Behavior Patterns of Ride-sharing Drivers**
    - Two different categories are identified: the home-work commuting drivers and the random commuting drivers; 
    - Counterintuitively, the home-work commuting ones account for only a small part of the total drivers
    - There is a high probability of being classified into the home-work commuting category when fewer trips are served by the specific driver
    - Results support and are in line with policy-making

* **Revealing Travel Patterns of Sharing-bikes in a Spatial-temporal Manner using Non-negative Matrix Factorization Method** ([Published in CICTP 2018](https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784481523.165))<br/>
  - Sharing bikes provide short-distance travel services around subway stations with three peaks<br/>
  - Bike-sharing could be expressed by three (or five) basis collective patterns which differ from ride-sharing of two collective patterns<br/>
  - The NMF method is more appropriate than PCA in extracting spatial-temporal patterns in transportation research

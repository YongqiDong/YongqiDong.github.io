I am Yongqi Dong, a Research Group Leader (AI & Automated Mobility) at RWTH Aachen University, a guest researcher at TU Delft, and previously a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley. With a broad interdisciplinary background, my ultimate goal is to employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and multi-disciplinary research as tools to shape a better world. To achieve this, I have focused on the transportation domain and explored various aspects of shared and automated mobility. 

Our group is <mark style="background-color: SpringGreen">actively seeking PhD students, (self-funded，e.g., <a href="https://www.csc.edu.cn/article/3296"><span style="color:blue">CSC</span></a>, <a href="https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/postdocnet/short-term-research-stay/"><span style="color:blue">DAAD</span></a>, <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/studium/im-studium/stipendien-foerderung/~fhgwb/advanced-research-opportunities-program/"><span style="color:blue">RWTH-AROP</span></a>, <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/rcph/lidx/1"><span style="color:blue">RWTH-Theodore von Kármán Fellowship</span></a>) visiting PhDs/RAs/Scholars, and Master's students (thesis projects)</mark> in the wide domain of Transportation & Traffic Engineering, Intelligent Transportation Systems, AI, Data Science, and Digital Twins.

Bio 
======
From January 2020 to May 2024, I was a member of the [Traffic and Transportation Safety Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/tts-lab) supervised by [Dr. Haneen Farah](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/transport-planning/staff/personal-pages/farah-h) and [Prof. Bart van Arem](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/transport-planning/staff/personal-pages/arem-b-van). My Ph.D. project is *Safe, Efficient, and Socially Compliant Automated Driving in Mixed Traffic: Sensing, Anomaly Detection, Planning and Control* [[thesis](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:12a9aff5-0cb6-46ab-a2d1-ae927d564913)]. The objective is to expand the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of automated vehicles with Artificial Intelligence, data-driven, and simulation-based methods. It is within the [Safe and efficient operation of AutoMated and human drivEN vehicles in mixed traffic (SAMEN)](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/samen) project, funded by the [Dutch Research Council (NWO)](https://www.nwo.nl/en). From May 2023 to October 2023, I visited the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, supervised by [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://msc.berkeley.edu/people/tomizuka.html). There, I cooperated with [Dr. Chen Tang](https://chentangmark.github.io/) on topics related to socially compliant automated driving.

I obtained my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University and my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU). I had also spent time at [Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART)](https://smart.mit.edu/) as a research intern.

My current research centres around the areas of Automated Vehicles, Smart & Shared Mobility, and Artificial Intelligence. I aim to develop innovative Deep Learning models for Automated Vehicles' sensing and Deep Reinforcement Learning models for Automated Vehicles' controlling, and thus realize ***Safe, Efficient, and Socially Compliant Automated Driving***. I have also delved into shared mobility employing big data analytics and machine learning techniques to reveal the unique spatial-temporal patterns. My previous works have been published in high-quality top journals and conferences, including *Transportation Research Part C*, *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, and *Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering*, as well as *IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems* (ITSC), _IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics_ (SMC), and *Transportation Research Board annual meeting* (TRB).

- **03/2025**: <span style="color:green">Need your help!</span> One of the Master's students I am supervising is conducting a research survey about socially compliant automated vehicles at [https://forms.gle/2k95HG4LXdkuPwiv8](https://forms.gle/2k95HG4LXdkuPwiv8). It would be helpful if you could spend 15- 25 minutes to fill out the survey. Please refer to the link for more details.
- **03/2025**: Following an extensive but slow review period of over two years, we recently achieved acceptance for **three** journal manuscripts. It appears that the **volunteer-based** peer review system may benefit from certain modifications to enhance its overall efficiency...

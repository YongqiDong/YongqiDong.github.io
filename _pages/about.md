I am Yongqi Dong 董永奇, a Ph.D. researcher at TU Delft, and a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley. I am a member of the [Traffic and Transportation Safety Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/tts-lab) supervised by [Dr. Haneen Farah](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/transport-planning/staff/personal-pages/farah-h) and [Prof. Bart van Arem](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/transport-planning/staff/personal-pages/arem-b-van). My Ph.D. project is *Data-Driven Research for Expanding Automated Vehicles Operational Design Domain in Mixed Traffic*. It is within the [Safe and efficient operation of AutoMated and human drivEN vehicles in mixed traffic (SAMEN)](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/samen) project, funded by the [Dutch Research Council (NWO)](https://www.nwo.nl/en). From May 2023 to October 2023, I visited the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, supervised by [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://msc.berkeley.edu/people/tomizuka.html). There, I cooperated with [Dr. Chen Tang](https://chentangmark.github.io/) on topics related to socially compliant automated driving.

I obtained my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University and my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU). I had also spent time at [Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART)](https://smart.mit.edu/research/fm/about-fm) as a research intern.

My current research centers around the areas of Automated Vehicles, Smart & Shared Mobility, and Artificial Intelligence. I aim to develop innovative Deep Learning models for Automated Vehicles' sensing and Deep Reinforcement Learning models for Automated Vehicles' controlling, and thus realize ***Safe, Efficient, and Socially Compliant Autonomous Driving***. I have also delved into shared mobility employing big data analytics and machine learning techniques to reveal the unique spatial-temporal patterns. My previous works have been published in high-quality top journals and conferences, including *Transportation Research Part C*, *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, and *Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering*, as well as *IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems* (ITSC), _IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics_ (SMC), and *Transportation Research Board annual meeting* (TRB).

I am Yongqi Dong 董永奇, a Ph.D. researcher at TU Delft. I am a member of the [Traffic and Transportation Safety Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/tts-lab) supervised by [Dr. Haneen Farah](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/transport-planning/staff/personal-pages/farah-h) and [Prof. Bart van Arem](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/transport-planning/staff/personal-pages/arem-b-van). My Ph.D. project is *Data-Driven Research for Expanding Automated Vehicles Operational Design Domain in Mixed Traffic*. It is within the [Safe and efficient operation of AutoMated and human drivEN vehicles in mixed traffic (SAMEN)](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/samen) project, funded by the [Dutch Research Council (NWO)](https://www.nwo.nl/en). Prior to joining TU Delft, I obtained my Master degree in Control Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University, and my Bachelor degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU). I had also spent time in [Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART)](https://smart.mit.edu/research/fm/about-fm) as a research intern.

My current research centers around the areas of Automated Vehicle, Smart & Shared Mobility, and Artificial Intelligence. I aim at developing innovative Deep Learning models for Automated Vehicles' sensing and Deep Reinforcement Learning models for Automated Vehicles' controlling, and thus realize *Safe, Efficient, and Socially Compliant Autonomous Driving*. I have also delved into shared mobility employing big data analytics and machine learning techniques to reveal the unique spatial-temporal patterns. My previous works have been published in high quality top journals and conferences, including *Transporation Research Part C*, *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, and *Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering*, as well as *IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)* and *Transportation Research Board annual meeting (TRB)*.

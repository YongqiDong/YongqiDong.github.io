I am Yongqi Dong 董永奇, a Ph.D. researcher at TU Delft. I am a member of the [Traffic and Transportation Safety Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/tts-lab) supervised by [Dr. Haneen Farah](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/transport-planning/staff/personal-pages/farah-h) and [Prof. Bart van Arem](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/transport-planning/staff/personal-pages/arem-b-van). My Ph.D. project is Data-Driven Research for Expanding Automated Vehicles Operational Design Domain in Mixed Traffic. It is within the [Safe and efficient operation of AutoMated and human drivEN vehicles in mixed traffic (SAMEN)](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/samen) project, funded by the [Dutch Research Council (NWO)](https://www.nwo.nl/en). Prior to joining TU Delft, I obtained my Master degree in Control Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University, and my Bachelor degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU). I had also spent time in [Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART)](https://smart.mit.edu/research/fm/about-fm) as a research intern.

My current research centers around the areas of Automated Vehicle, Smart & Shared Mobility, and Artificial Intelligence. I aim at developing innovative Deep Learning models for Automated Vehicles' sensing and Deep Reinforcement Learning models for Automated Vehicles' controlling, and thus realize Safe, Efficient, and Socially Compliant Autonomous Driving. I have also delved into shared mobility employing big data analytics and machine learning techniques. My previous works have been published in high quality top journals and conferences, including Transporation Research Part C, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, and Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.

I am Yongqi Dong, a Research Group Leader (AI & Automated Mobility) at RWTH Aachen University, PhD researcher at TU Delft, and previously a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley. With a broad interdisciplinary background, my ultimate goal is to employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and multi-disciplinary research as tools to shape a better world. To achieve this, I have focused on the transportation domain and explored various aspects of shared and automated mobility. 

Our group is <mark style="background-color: SpringGreen">actively seeking PhD students, visiting (CSC-funded) PhDs/RAs/Scholars, and Master's students (thesis projects)</mark> in the wide domain of Transportation & Traffic Engineering, Intelligent Transportation Systems, AI, Data Science, and Digital Twins. Typical research areas include:
- Connected Automated Vehicles
- Mixed-Autonomy Traffic 
- Driving Risk Modelling
- Transport & Traffic Safety
- Socially Compliant Decision-making
- Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Shared Smart & Sustainable Mobility
- Smart Logistics & Delivery Robots
- Lane Detection, Object Detection & Tracking
- Multi-modal Data Fusion & Data Mining in Transportation Research
- Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning/Large Language Models for Automated Mobility
- Explainable AI Applications in Mobility & Interdisciplinary Problems

Bio 
======
From January 2020 to May 2024, I was a member of the [Traffic and Transportation Safety Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/tts-lab) supervised by [Dr. Haneen Farah](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/transport-planning/staff/personal-pages/farah-h) and [Prof. Bart van Arem](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/transport-planning/staff/personal-pages/arem-b-van). My Ph.D. project is *Safe, Efficient, and Socially Compliant Automated Driving in Mixed Traffic: Sensing, Anomaly Detection, Planning and Control* [[thesis](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:12a9aff5-0cb6-46ab-a2d1-ae927d564913)]. The objective is to expand the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of automated vehicles with Artificial Intelligence, data-driven, and simulation-based methods. It is within the [Safe and efficient operation of AutoMated and human drivEN vehicles in mixed traffic (SAMEN)](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/samen) project, funded by the [Dutch Research Council (NWO)](https://www.nwo.nl/en). From May 2023 to October 2023, I visited the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, supervised by [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://msc.berkeley.edu/people/tomizuka.html). There, I cooperated with [Dr. Chen Tang](https://chentangmark.github.io/) on topics related to socially compliant automated driving.

I obtained my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University and my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU). I had also spent time at [Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART)](https://smart.mit.edu/) as a research intern.

My current research centres around the areas of Automated Vehicles, Smart & Shared Mobility, and Artificial Intelligence. I aim to develop innovative Deep Learning models for Automated Vehicles' sensing and Deep Reinforcement Learning models for Automated Vehicles' controlling, and thus realize ***Safe, Efficient, and Socially Compliant Automated Driving***. I have also delved into shared mobility employing big data analytics and machine learning techniques to reveal the unique spatial-temporal patterns. My previous works have been published in high-quality top journals and conferences, including *Transportation Research Part C*, *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, and *Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering*, as well as *IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems* (ITSC), _IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics_ (SMC), and *Transportation Research Board annual meeting* (TRB).

And I just recently got my [TU Delft Form B & C & D](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/onderzoek/graduate-school/process-forms#:~:text=Form%20B,Form%20D) signed, which means just waiting for the denfense. These achievements mark a significant milestone in my educational journey.
